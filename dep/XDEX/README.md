Programs for Android are commonly written in Java and compiled to bytecode for the Java virtual machine, 
which is then translated to **Dalvik bytecode** and stored in .dex (**Dalvik EXecutable**) 
and .odex (**Optimized Dalvik EXecutable**) files; 
related terms odex and de-odex are associated with respective bytecode conversions. 
The compact **Dalvik Executable** format is designed for systems that are constrained 
in terms of memory and processor speed.
