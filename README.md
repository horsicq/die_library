# DiE (Detect It Easy) Library Documentation

## Overview

The DiE (Detect It Easy) library is an open-source project designed to provide a flexible and efficient way to detect packers, cryptors, and compilers in executable files. This documentation will guide you through the process of setting up and using the library.

## Prerequisites

Before building the DiE library, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- **Qt**: The Qt framework is required for building the project.
- **CMake**: CMake is used for managing the build process.
- **Compiler**: A C++ compiler compatible with your operating system (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

git clone --recursive https://github.com/horsicq/die_library.git &&
cd die_library

## Building the Project

### Linux

1. **Install Qt and CMake**:

For Debian 10 (Buster) and Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) and earlier:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install qt5-default cmake build-essential

For Debian 11 (Bullseye) and Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa) and later:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install qtbase5-dev qtchooser qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev-tools qtscript5-dev

2. **Create a build directory**:

mkdir build
cd build

3. **Generate Makefiles using CMake**:

cmake ..

4. **Build the project**:

make

### Windows

1. **Install Qt and CMake**:
   - Download and install Qt from [Qt's official website](https://www.qt.io/download).
   - Download and install CMake from [CMake's official website](https://cmake.org/download/).

2. **Create a build directory**:

mkdir build
cd build

3. **Generate Visual Studio project files using CMake**:

cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 16 2019"

4. **Build the project**:
   Open the generated `.sln` file in Visual Studio and build the solution.

### macOS

1. **Install Qt and CMake**:

brew install qt cmake

2. **Create a build directory**:

mkdir build
cd build

3. **Generate Makefiles using CMake**:

cmake ..

4. **Build the project**:

make
